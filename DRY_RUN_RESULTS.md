## 🚀 Ready for Production

The lab is **fully functional** and ready for immediate use. Here's what works:

### **Automated Setup**
```bash
cd diffusion_lab
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

### **Manual Verification**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python validate_setup.py  # Comprehensive validation
python test_setup.py      # Basic functionality test
```

### **Ready to Use**
```bash
# Interactive lab
python lab_runner.py

# Jupyter notebooks
jupyter notebook notebooks/

# Hands-on exercises
python exercises/exercise_1_basic_generation.py
```
